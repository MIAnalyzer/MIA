.. include:: ../icons.txt

To label an image select a tool and draw inside the image to label image objects.

.. note:: 
   There is no save option as all changes during labelling are saved immediately. Use |reset| or :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`z` to undo the last labelling action.
   
   All labels are saved in a subfolder inside the currently active folder and have the same file name as the currently selected image, but with :code:`.npz` as file extension.
