Object Detection
****************

Object detection is the identification of the position of each target object in an image. Object detection can be used for quantification, counting or tracking.

Labelling
=========
To train a neural network for object detection it is necessary to create images that are labelled accordingly.

  Object detection tools
  
Different tools and functions in MIA exist to label images for object detection.

.. include:: ../applications/labelling.rst

Tools
-----

By selecting the |drag| tool or pressing :kbd:`F1` you can always switch to the drag tool to zoom and change the field of view. Press the :kbd:`Spacebar` to toggle between drag tool and the last selected tool.

Use |addobject| (or press :kbd:`F2`) to add objects. Press :kbd:`left_mouse` on the target object to label its position with the current active class.

With |shift| (or press :kbd:`F3`) you can shift objects. Press and hold the :kbd:`left_mouse` near a labelled object and drag to move its position.

The |assign| tool (or press :kbd:`F4`) can be used to asssign a new class to an existing object. Select the target class and press the :kbd:`left_mouse` close to an existing object.

The |delete| tool (or press :kbd:`F5`) can be used to remove objects. Press the :kbd:`left_mouse` close to a contour to remove that contour.


Auto Detection
--------------

Press the |magicwand| **Auto Detection** Button to perform deep learning edge detection based on Holistically-nested edge detection [#hed]_.

.. note::
  The Auto Detection is experimental and might only work well for closed objects with a clear boundary (e.g. isolated fluorescent cells).
  
Training
========

For details about neural network training see :doc:`../training/index`. However, some settings, the network architectures, the loss functions, metrics are specific for object detection.

Object Detection Settings
-------------------------

To open the segmenation settings, press: 
|train| *Train Model* |rarr| |settings| *Detection*.

  Object detection training settings
  
  
Adjust the **Object Size** slider to adapt for different object sizes that are detected. This is mostly important for distances between objects, for dense images choose a low object size and vice versa.

Change the **Object Intensity** slider to change the likelyhood of object detection. If a trained model fails to detect some objects while having only very few false positives, increase object intensity and retrain.
  
Checking **Prefer labelled parts** will **Discard up to x background tiles** in which are less than **Minimum required labelled pixels** (a pixel corresponds to an object), which can be set in the corresponding fields. For largely unbalanced datasets with a lot of background and fewer objects this option is recommended.
For unbalanced datasets see also class weighting in :doc:`../training/trainsettings`.

Neural Network architectures
----------------------------

The neural network architectures are identical to semantic segmentaion (see :ref:`segarchitectures`), but the output layer is linear that is estimated via regression.
  
Losses and Metrics
------------------

As object detection is solved as a regression problem, common regression losses and metric functions can be chosen:

Mean Squared Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
  L_{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(p_i - q_i)^2}
  
with :math:`p_i` the true label and :math:`q_i` the model prediction for the :math:`i_{th}` data point.

Root Mean Squared Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
  L_{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(p_i - q_i)^2}}.
  

Mean Squared Logarithmic Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
  L_{MSLE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(log(p_i+1) - log(q_i+1))^2}}.

Mean Absolute Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
  L_{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{|p_i - q_i|}.

Postprocessing
==============

To open the postprocessing window press |postprocessing| *Postprocessing*.

  Postprocessing options for object detection
  
See :doc:`../postprocessing/tracking` for a description of the tracking mode. 

Press the **Use as Stack label** button to use the currently shown contours for all frames in the currently active stack. Only applicable when using a multi-frame image stack.
