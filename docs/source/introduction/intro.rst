MIA: Microscopic Image Analyzer
*******************************

**MIA is an open source, stand-alone software based on deep learning for the analysis of bioimaging data.**

As the name suggest MIA is designed for microscopic imaging data, yet the software can be use for a wide range of imaging data.

Features:

* Labelling of training data with multiple tools including assisted and automatic labelling
* Including different applications: :doc:`../applications/classification`, :doc:`../applications/segmentation`, object :doc:`../applications/objectdetection` and :doc:`../postprocessing/tracking`
* Pipeline for neural network :doc:`../training/index` with several hyperparameters to optimize and fine tune network performance
* Multiple implemented network architectures and pretrained models
* Model predictions and the option to correct and improve results
* Compatibility with other open source projects like ImageJ or CellProfiler
* Runs on windows and linux
